# TextCompressor

### This tool uses Huffman Coding to compress data! 
**Huffman Coding** is a popular technique used for Lossless Data Compression. 
    
*Lossless compression* is a class of data compression algorithms that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. It is preffered for text file compression, 

*Lossy compression* permits reconstruction only of an approximate amount of the original data, though usually with greatly improved compression rates. It is generally preferred for audio, video and image files.
